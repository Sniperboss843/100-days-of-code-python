# 100-days-of-code-python
I am committing to the #100DaysOfCode challenge.

I will be coding for at least 1 hour a day. I will follow the 100 Days of Python from Angela YU on Udemy and the Python documentation as well as the documentation from MDN for JavaScript.

I prefer learning from a book. But I've taken other Angela Yu's courses: The Web Development Bootcamp and the Flutter Development Bootcamp, and she's a great teacher. But if you look at the curriculum from the 100 Days of Python, it is a little bit different; especially in the last couple of days.

The Python documentation website is like a book. As such, it has thorough explanation on how the code works inside-out through a large number of tutorials. You might be wondering: but German, why don't you do one thing first and then the other when you're done?

Glad you ask that.

I'll be doing the Python Documentation so I can make it a hobby to always visit the docs when my code is not running well.

Wish me luck!
