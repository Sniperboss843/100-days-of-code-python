# 100-days-of-code-python
I am committing to the #100DaysOfCode challenge.

I will be coding for at least 1 hour a day. I will follow the 100 Days of Python from Angela YU on Udemy and the Python documentation to learn!

I'm a young programing enthusiast taking this course to grow my pyhon skills hopefully I learn a lot I already know frontend devlopment and java script so I think Python will be a great Language for me 

Wish me luck!
